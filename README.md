Instructions:

Run the script using a Python interpreter (Python 3 recommended).
Follow the on-screen prompts to input the probabilities of Player A and Player B winning a serve, as well as the number of games to be simulated.
The simulation will then run, providing a game summary after each game, including the number of serves, scores, and wins for each player.
The simulation continues until the specified number of games is reached.
Note:

The game simulation stops when the specified number of games is completed.
The script uses the random() function to determine the outcome of serves based on the input probabilities.
Feel free to customize the script or use it as a basis for more complex simulations.
